When writing or updating code:
- Always use React.memo for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.useCallback for event handlers and functions passed as props
- Use React.useMemo for expensive computations and static data arrays
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks (useLocalStorage, useProjects, etc)
- Never store sensitive data (passwords, API keys) directly in code - use config.js
- Add rate limiting to forms (minimum 10 seconds between submissions)
- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML - use safe alternatives
- Use error boundaries to catch and handle component errors gracefully
- Add passive: true to scroll event listeners for better performance
- Use try-catch blocks for localStorage operations (may fail in private browsing)
- Validate all data from localStorage before using
- Use const for values that don't change, let for those that do
- Prefer arrow functions for inline callbacks
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
